in load combination cases 1 to 5 and 1.0 **D** in load combination case 6 of Table 4.1.3.2.B., shall be used when the _dead load_
acts to resist overturning, uplift, sliding, failure due to stress reversal, and to determine anchorage requirements and the factored resistance of members.

**4.1.8.7. Methods of Analysis**

**(1)** Analysis for design earthquake actions shall be carried out in accordance with the Dynamic Analysis Procedure described in Article 4.1.8.12., except that the Equivalent Static Force Procedure described in Article 4.1.8.11. may be used for structures that meet any of the following criteria:

(a) in cases where IEFaSa(0.2) is less than 0.35,

(b) regular structures that are less than 60 m in height and have a fundamental lateral period, Ta, less than 2 s in each of two orthogonal directions as defined in Article 4.1.8.8., or

(c) structures with structural irregularity, of Type 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6 or 8 as defined in Table 4.1.8.6., that are less than 20 m in height and have a fundamental lateral period, Ta, less than 0.5 s in each of two orthogonal directions as defined in Article 4.1.8.8.

**4.1.8.8. Direction of Loading**

**(1)** Earthquake forces shall be assumed to act in any horizontal direction, except that the following shall be considered to provide adequate design force levels in the structure:

(a) where components of the SFRS are oriented along a set of orthogonal axes, independent analyses about each of the principal axes of the structure shall be performed,

(b) where the components of the SFRS are not oriented along a set of orthogonal axes and IEFaSa(0.2) is less than 0.35, independent analyses about any two orthogonal axes is permitted, or

(c) where the components of the SFRS are not oriented along a set of orthogonal axes and IEFaSa(0.2) is equal to or greater than 0.35, analysis of the structure independently in any two orthogonal directions for 100% of the prescribed earthquake loads applied in one direction plus 30% of the prescribed earthquake loads in the perpendicular direction, with the combination requiring the greater element strength being used in the design.

**4.1.8.9. SFRS Force Reduction Factors, System Overstrength Factors, and General Restrictions**

**(1)** Except as provided in Sentence 4.1.8.20.(7), the values of Rd
and Ro and the corresponding system restrictions shall conform to Table 4.1.8.9. and the requirements of this Subsection.

**(2)** When a particular value of Rd is required by this Article, the corresponding Ro shall be used.

**(3)** For combinations of different types of SFRS acting in the same direction in the same _storey_, RdRo shall be taken as the lowest value of RdRo corresponding to these systems.

**(4)** For vertical variations of RdRo, excluding rooftop structures not exceeding two _storeys_ in height whose weight is less than the greater of 10% of W and 30% of Wi of the level below, the value of RdRo used in the design of any _storey_ shall be less than or equal to the lowest value of RdRo used in the given direction for the _storeys_ above, and the requirements of Sentence 4.1.8.15.(5) must be satisfied.

**(5)** If it can be demonstrated through testing, research and analysis that the seismic performance of a structural system is at least equivalent to one of the types of SFRS mentioned in Table 4.1.8.9., then such a structural system will qualify for values of Rd and Ro corresponding to the equivalent type in that Table.

Notes to Table A-8:

(1) Beam spans apply only where the floors serve residential areas as described in Table 4.1.5.3., or the uniformly distributed _live load_ on the floors does not exceed that specified for residential areas as described in Table 4.1.5.3.

(2) When the floors have a concrete topping of not more than 51 mm, the spans must be multiplied by 0.8.

(3) Supported length means half the sum of the joists spans on both sides of the beam.

(4) Straight interpolation may be used for other supported lengths.

(5) Spans are clear spans between supports.  For total span, add two bearing lengths.

(6) 3-ply beams with supported lengths greater than 4.2 m require minimum bearing length of 114 mm.  All other beams require minimum bearing length of 76 mm.

Notes to Table A-9:

(1) Beam spans apply only where the floors serve residential areas as described in Table 4.1.5.3., or the uniformly distributed _live load_ on the floors does not exceed that specified for residential areas as described in Table 4.1.5.3.

(2) When the floors have a concrete topping of not more than 51 mm, the spans must be multiplied by 0.8.

(3) Supported length means half the sum of the joists spans on both sides of the beam.

(4) Straight interpolation may be used for other supported lengths.

(5) Spans are clear spans between supports.  For total span, add two bearing lengths.

(6) 3-ply beams require minimum bearing length of 114 mm.  4-ply and 5-ply beams with supported lengths greater than 3 m require minimum bearing length of 114 mm.  All other beams require minimum bearing length of 76 mm.

Notes to Table A-10:

(1) Beam spans apply only where the floors serve residential areas as described in Table 4.1.5.3., or the uniformly distributed _live load_ on the floors does not exceed that specified for residential areas as described in Table 4.1.5.3.

(2) When the floors have a concrete topping of not more than 51 mm, the spans must be multiplied by 0.8.

(3) Supported length means half the sum of the joists spans on both sides of the beam.

(4) Straight interpolation may be used for other supported lengths.

(5) Spans are clear spans between supports.  For total span, add two bearing lengths.

(6) 3-ply beams with supported lengths greater than 4.2 m require minimum bearing length of 152 mm.  All other beams require minimum bearing length of 114 mm.

Notes to Table A-12:

(1) Beam and lintel spans are calculated based on a maximum supported length of 4.9 m.  Spans may be increased by 5% for supported lengths of not more than 4.3 m, by 10% for supported lengths of not more than 3.7 m, and by 25% for supported lengths of not more than 2.4 m.

(2) For ridge beams, supported length means half the sum of the rafter, joist or truss spans on both sides of the beam.  For lintels, supported length means half the sum of truss, roof joist or rafter spans supported by the lintel plus the length of the overhang beyond the lintel.

(3) Provide a minimum bearing length of 76 mm.

(1) Where structural sheathing is used, lintel spans may be increased by 15%.  Structural sheathing consists of a minimum 9.5 mm thick structural panel conforming to CSA O121, CSA O151, CSA O325 or CSA O437.0 fastened with at least two rows of fasteners to the exterior face of the lintel, and a single row to the top plates and studs.  Fasteners shall conform to Table 9.23.3.5.

(2) A single piece of 89 mm thick lumber may be used in lieu of 2 pieces of 38 mm thick lumber on edge.

(3) If floor joists span the full width of the _building_
without support, lintel spans shall be reduced by 15% for “Roof, ceiling and 1 _storey_”, by 20% for “Roof, ceiling and 2 _storeys”_, and by 25% for “Roof, ceiling and 3 _storeys”_.

(4) For ends of lintels fully supported by walls, provide minimum bearing length of 38 mm for lintel spans up to 3 m, or minimum bearing length of 76 mm for lintel spans greater than 3 m.

(5) Spans for 0.6 m tributary width are calculated for lintels in end walls that support only a 0.6 m width of roof and ceiling, but do not support roof joists, roof rafters or roof trusses.

(6) Lintel spans are calculated based on a maximum floor joist, roof joist or rafter span of 4.9 m and a maximum roof truss span of 9.8 m.  Lintel spans may be increased by 5% if rafter and joist spans are not more than 4.3 m and roof truss spans are not more than 8.6 m.  Spans may be increased by 10% if rafter and joist spans are not more than 3.7 m and roof trusses are not more than 7.4 m.

(7) Spans apply only where the floors serve residential areas as described in Table 4.1.5.3., or the uniformly distributed _live load_ does not exceed that specified for residential areas as described in Table 4.1.5.3.

**10.2.1.1. Classification of Major Occupancy**

**(1)** Every existing _building_ or part of it shall be classified according to its _major occupancy_ in accordance with the requirements of Subsection 3.1.2.

**10.2.1.2. Classification According to Construction and Occupancy**

**(1)** For the purposes of this Part, existing _buildings_
shall be classified as to their _construction_ and _occupancy_ as provided for in Sentence 11.2.1.1.(1).

**10.2.1.3. Building Size and Construction**

**(1)** The requirements of Articles 3.2.2.20. to 3.2.2.83. do not apply to this Part.

Section 10.3. Requirements

10.3.1. General

**10.3.1.1. General**

**(1)** Except as provided in Section 10.4., a _building_
or part of a _building_ subject to a change of _major occupancy_ shall conform to the requirements of Subsection 3.2.6., Sections 3.7., 3.11. and 3.12., Sentences 6.2.2.1.(2), 6.2.3.9.(1) and 6.2.4.7.(1), Subsections 9.5.1. and 9.5.3. to 9.5.10., Sentences 9.6.1.4.(3), (4) and (7) to (9), Article 9.7.2.3., Sentences 9.8.8.1.(5) to (9) and 9.9.10.1.(1) to (7), Subsection 9.10.17., Sections 9.31. and 9.32., and Subsections 9.34.1. to 9.34.3. as they apply to the new _major occupancy_ that the _building_
or part of a _building_ is to support.

10.3.2. Performance Level

**10.3.2.1. General**

**(1)** The _performance level_ of a _building_
after the change of _major occupancy_ shall not be less than the _performance level_ prior to the change of _major occupancy_.

**(2)** For the purposes of Sentence (1), reduction of _performance level_
shall be determined in accordance with Article 10.3.2.2.

**10.3.2.2. Reduction in Performance Level**

**(1)** Except as provided in Sentence (2), the _performance level_ of a _building_ or part of a _building_
is reduced where the existing structural floor and roof framing systems and their supporting members are not adequate to support the proposed _dead loads_ and _live loads_ of the new _major occupancy_ that the _building_ is to support.

**(2)** The inadequacy of the existing structural floor or roof framing system and its supporting members to support the proposed _dead loads_ and _live loads_ does not reduce the _performance level_ of the _building_ if the portion of the floor affected by the proposed loads is restricted to the loading it will support and signs stating the restrictions are posted.

**(3)** Except as provided in Section 10.4., the _performance level_ of a _building_ or part of a _building_
is reduced where the early warning and evacuation systems requirements of the _building_ do not meet the early warning and evacuation systems requirements set out in Table 10.3.2.2.A. for the new _major occupancy_ that the _building_
is to support.
